# ReAnimator
A animation program for TempleOS.

## Run it inside TempleOS
* Use redseafs for Linux or redseaexplorer for Windows and turn the folder into a ISO file
* Put the ISO as CD on Temple OS
* Go to T: and then execute Run.HC.z

## How to watch the exported animations
The animation exports in HC format which means that it can be executed

## Demonstration (because i'm too lazy to write how this works

## TODO
* Import the exported file
